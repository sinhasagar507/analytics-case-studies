# Human Resources Data Dashboard

## Project Overview

Organizations continuously strive to enhance their workforce management strategies. With the rise of data-driven decision-making, HR analytics has become a critical tool for analyzing employee demographics, performance, and trends. The project focuses on creating an interactive dashboard that provides actionable insights into human resource data, enabling better workforce planning and management.

## Executive Summary

This project leverages dummy HR data (generated by ChatGPT) from 2015-2024 to analyze workforce trends, performance metrics, and salary distributions using **Tableau Desktop** app. Two dashboards have been developed accordingly:

1. **Overview Dashboard**: A high-level summary of employee statistics, including headcount, hiring and termination trends, department distribution, and demographics.
2. **Insights Dashboard**: An insightful deep  of salary trends, performance metrics, education levels, and other workforce analytics.

The aim is to derive actionable insights to enhance workforce management and decision-making.Some key findings include:

- **Department Trends**: Operations and Sales exhibit the highest employee turnover, while IT and Finance maintain higher retention.
- **Salary Insights**: The role of Finance Manager shows the highest median salaries, while HR roles exhibit the largest gender pay gap.
- **Performance Analysis**: Employees with Masterâ€™s degrees tend to have higher performance ratings.
Demographics:
- **Gender Ratio**: A slight gender disparity is 54% Male, 46% Female.
- **Education Levels**: Bachelor's degrees dominate at 60%, with consistent performance advantages.

## Insights Deep-Dive

### Overview

<p align="center">
<img src="images/active_employees.png" alt="Active Employees" width="80%">
</p>
- **Employees**: 7,984 active employees with clear hiring and termination trends, including spikes in terminations during specific years. Moreover, the trend in employee hiring and termination has followed a similar trend over the years. The overall attrition rate through all the years stands at 10.79%, which seems to be on the lower side.

</p>
- **Departmental Breakdown**: Operations has the largest headcount and the highest terminations, followed by Sales and Customer Service. The trend in hiring and termination is also similar across different departments. Operations and Sales exhibit the highest employee hiring as well as turnover, whereas Finance and HR exhibit the lowest.

</p>
- **Regional Breakdown**: The state of New York has the largest number of active employees, with 70% of the workforce based at the headquarters in NYC. The initial employment in 2015 happened in Michigan, followed by employments in Pennsylvania and New York in 2016. Thereafter, the hiring spread to some other states of the Midwest and Northeast, namely Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia and North Carolina.

- **Gender Ratio**: The workforce comprises 54% male and 46% female employees, reflecting a slight male predominance across departments. Hiring and termination rates are consistent across both genders, with 89% of employees hired and 11% terminated during the observed period (from 2015-2024).


<p align="center">
  <img src="images/education_age_performance.png" alt="Regional Breakdown" width="80%">
</p>
- **Education and Age**: Majority of employees are in the 25-34 age range, indicating a younger workforce.Bachelor's degrees dominate at 60%, correlating with consistent performance advantages. Higher degrees (PhDs and Masters) demonstrate better performance levels, with PhDs rated "Excellent."

### Income

  <img src="images/education_gender_women.png" alt="Insights Dashboard" width="40%">
</p>

- Women with high school or Bachelor's degrees earn less than men, requiring equity adjustments, whereas women with Master's degrees or PhDs earn more than men at the same level, which also needs to be standardized.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/age_salary.png" alt="Age & Salary" width="80%">
</p>
- Employees working as Managers across different departments earn some of the highest salaries, whereas employees across HR and sales earn lower salaries.

## Recommendations

- **Address Pay Gaps**: Initiate salary equity adjustments, particularly for women who have high-school or a bachelors degree as the highest education level as compared to women with the same highest level. On the other hand, women holding masters degree or a PHD earn higher than men at the same level, which also needs to be addressed.
- **Retention Strategies**: Focus on mentoring and growth opportunities in high-turnover departments (e.g., Operations and Sales).
- **Upskilling Programs**: Develop targeted training for employees in the "Needs Improvement" category to improve productivity.
- **Hiring Optimizations**: Refine recruitment pipelines to target demographics (e.g., young graduates) with high potential for retention and performance.
- **Gender Discrepancies**: Address gender discrepancies to ensure women are adequately represented in the workforce.
